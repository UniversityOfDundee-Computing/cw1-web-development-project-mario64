		</p>
		<p>Production of <i>Super Mario 64</i> began on September 7, 1994, at Nintendo's <a
				href="/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_Analysis_%26_Development"
				title="Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development">Entertainment Analysis & Development</a> division,
			and concluded on May 20, 1996. According to Miyamoto, the development team consisted of around fifteen to
			twenty people. Development began with the characters and the <a href="/wiki/Virtual_camera_system"
				title="Virtual camera system">camera system</a>; months were spent selecting a view and layout. The
			original concept involved the fixed path of an isometric game such as <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG"
					title="Super Mario RPG">Super Mario RPG</a></i>, which moved to a free-roaming 3D design, with some
			linear paths, particularly to coerce the player into Bowser's lair, according to Giles Goddard.
		</p>
		<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> is one of the first games for which Nintendo produced its illustrations internally
			instead of by <a href="/wiki/Outsourcing" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a>. The graphics were made using
			<a href="/wiki/N-World" title="N-World">N-World</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Graphics"
				title="Silicon Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> (SGI)-based toolkit. The development team prioritized
			Mario's movement and, before levels were created, tested and refined Mario's animations on a simple grid.
			The 3D illustrations were created by <a href="/wiki/Shigefumi_Hino" title="Shigefumi Hino">Shigefumi
				Hino</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hisashi_Nogami" title="Hisashi Nogami">Hisashi Nogami</a>, Hideki Fujii,
			Tomoaki Kuroume, and <a href="/wiki/Yusuke_Nakano" class="mw-redirect" title="Yusuke Nakano">Yusuke
				Nakano</a>, and the game was animated by co-director <a href="/wiki/Yoshiaki_Koizumi"
				title="Yoshiaki Koizumi">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a> and Satoru Takiwaza. <a href="/wiki/Y%C5%8Dichi_Kotabe"
				title="Y≈çichi Kotabe">Y≈çichi Kotabe</a>, illustrator and character designer for the <i>Mario</i> series,
			made a 3D drawing of Mario from various angles and directed the creation of the character models. In an
			interview with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington
					Post</a></i>, Yoshiaki Koizumi recalled that his challenge was animating the 3D models without any
			precedents. To assist players with <a href="/wiki/Depth_perception" title="Depth perception">depth
				perception</a>, the team positioned a faux shadow directly beneath each object regardless of the area's
			lighting. Yoshiaki Koizumi described the feature as an "iron-clad necessity" which "might not be realistic,
			but it's much easier to play".
		</p>
		<p>Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy was to include more details than earlier games by using the Nintendo
			64's power to feature "all the emotions of the characters". He likened the game's style to a 3D interactive
			cartoon. Some details were inspired by the developers' personal lives; for example, the <a
				href="/wiki/List_of_Mario_franchise_characters#Enemy_characters"
				title="List of Mario franchise characters">Boos</a> are based on assistant director <a
				href="/wiki/Takashi_Tezuka" title="Takashi Tezuka">Takashi Tezuka</a>'s wife, who, as Miyamoto
			explained, "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at
			work".
		</p>
		<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> was first run on an <a href="/wiki/SGI_Onyx" title="SGI Onyx">SGI Onyx</a> emulator,
			which only emulated the console's <a href="/wiki/Application_programming_interface"
				title="Application programming interface">application programming interface</a> and not its hardware.
			The first test scenario for controls and physics involved Mario interacting with a golden rabbit, named
			"MIPS" after the Nintendo 64's <a href="/wiki/MIPS_architecture" title="MIPS architecture">MIPS
				architecture</a> processors; the rabbit was included in the final game as a Power Star holder. <i>Super
				Mario 64</i> features more puzzles than earlier <i>Mario</i> games. It was developed simultaneously with
			<i><a href="/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" title="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time">The
					Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></i> but, as <i>Ocarina of Time</i> was released more than two
			years later, some puzzles were taken for <i>Super Mario 64</i>. The developers tried to include a <a
				href="/wiki/Multiplayer" title="Multiplayer">multiplayer</a> cooperative mode, whereby players would
			control Mario and his brother <a href="/wiki/Luigi" title="Luigi">Luigi</a> in <a
				href="/wiki/Split_screen_(video_games)" title="Split screen (video games)">split-screen</a>.
			Nevertheless, hardware constraints and the developers' inability to implement the mode satisfactorily led to
			its removal.
